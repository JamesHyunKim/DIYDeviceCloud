DIY Device Cloud Documentation
==============================

The internet of things sucks. We were promised a future of amazing devices that connect seamlessly and communicate freely. In reality we've been given gadgets that solve questionable needs, services that wall off and own our data, and endless marketing nonsense. It's time to stop talking about the internet of things and start making it a reality. Like the underground music scene of the 80's that built its own future, the makers, hackers, and garage inventors of today need to lead the way to an internet of things that doesn't suck. The DIY device cloud project's goal is to provide tools and information for anyone to build their own cloud of connected devices.
